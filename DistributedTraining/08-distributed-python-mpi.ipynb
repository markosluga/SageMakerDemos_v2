    "[Open MPI](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) is a tool that allows us to convert a single-threaded python program into a parallel python program. \n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker can use MPI to deploy multiple python threads on a single instance, or set up multiple instances with multiple threads each. In this demo we will deploy **multiple instances** that will run 2 parallel processes each. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mpi_demo.py python script provided in this demo ensures each process spawned looks for other processes and communicates with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the process can not communicate wiht other spawned processes it will fail and thus the training job would fail aswell. \n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality deonstrates that a single threaded process is being parallelized, which means you can import your existing single threaded training scripts and paralelize them with ease. \n"
